The goal of this project is to make it more convenient to use [differential Cartesian Genetic Programming](https://github.com/darioizzo/dcgp) (dCGP) and to make tools that help with inspecting a chromosome. The underlaying idea is that dCGP will move one step further from an academic experiment towards a product (software tool) helpful for engineering.
